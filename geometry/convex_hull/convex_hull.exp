[Andrew's monotone chain convex hull algorithm]
The convex hull algorithm first calculates the lower hull and then the upper hull.
if there are:
	+ 0,1 point in the vector, the algorithm returns an empty list
	+ 2 points in the vector, the algorithm returns the 2 points
	+ only colinear points in the vector, the algorithm returns the two outer ones
